## Task 1: Web Application Security Testing

### Overview
This repository contains all deliverables for **Task 1** of my internship with **Future Interns (Cyber Security Track)**.  
The objective is to perform security testing on a web application, identify vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, XSS, authentication flaws), and provide mitigation strategies.

---

### ✅ Tools Used
- **Burp Suite** – For intercepting and manipulating HTTP requests
- **SQLMap** – For automated SQL Injection exploitation
- **Nmap** – For port scanning and service detection
- **Gobuster** – For directory brute-forcing
- **WhatWeb** – For web technology fingerprinting

---

### ✅ Steps Performed
1. **Reconnaissance** – Identified open ports and web technologies
2. **Directory Enumeration** – Discovered hidden paths
3. **SQL Injection Testing** – Detected and exploited injection points using Burp Suite & SQLMap
4. **XSS Testing** – Checked for reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities
5. **Authentication Testing** – Analyzed login security and weak credentials

---

### ✅ Deliverables
- **[Security Report](report.md)** – Detailed report of all findings with mitigations
- **Screenshots Folder** – Evidence of exploitation steps

---

### ✅ How to Navigate
- `report.md` → Complete vulnerability analysis
- `screenshots/` → Exploitation proof
